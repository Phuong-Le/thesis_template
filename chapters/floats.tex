\chapter{Figures and Tables}
As you might know already, both figures and tables are considered \glspl{float}. Depending on the discipline/institution, you might need to set up your float in some specific ways. Some people like to anchor floats to the top of the page, so it is easy to find them. When I wrote my thesis, it was preferable to put floats after and closest possible to the first texts that describe them, so I set floats to \texttt{[ht!]}, which forces floats to be either ``here'' or at the ``top'' of the next page, as seen in the figures and tables in this chapter. You can read more about float settings \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Positioning_of_Figures}{here}.
