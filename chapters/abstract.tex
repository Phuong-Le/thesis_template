An abstract is meant to be the summary of the whole thesis. It is something you put at the beginning of your thesis but work on last during your writing process. Think of it as the one page you choose if you had to choose only one page of your thesis to show to a general audience - make it complete, precise, simple, and if possible, attractice. \href{https://services.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/471274/Writing_an_Abstract_Update_051112.pdf}{Here} is a good guide to writing abstract.
