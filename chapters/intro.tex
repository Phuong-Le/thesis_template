\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Welcome and thank you for taking your time to look at this thesis template and potentially using it. This template was first produced during my Honours year at the Research school of Biology (RSB) at the Australian National University. For this reason, the formatting was designed according to the requirements set by the RSB, but you can easily adjust the settings in the \texttt{setup.tex} file. In making the template, I tried to be as detailed as I could to produce a document that I personally find very pretty. I have at least two people who agree with me: my lab-mate, who asked to use the code even before it was finished, and one of my examiners, who asked for permission to share the template with their students. In addition, I hope the template is useful for \LaTeX beginners, because \LaTeX is super convenient for large documents like theses.

Following this chapter is a demonstration of how the template will appear as a pdf document. Part \ref{part:codes} contains tips to present/structure your document, including \LaTeX\ tips. Part \ref{part:writing} contains tips on writing styles. Please replace these tips with your own contents, but I hope you find them helpful - I know I will go back to them in the future myself. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback. I would also be curious to see the variation you make to the style of the template if there is any. I hope you have fun writing and I wish you all the best.
