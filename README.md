### A Pretty thesis

This is a thesis template I wrote for my Honours at the Australian National University.

### Installation 

DON'T git clone the repository as you want your thesis to either have its own repo or be part of the repo for your research project.

I recommend the following

```
cd /path/to/project/directory
wget https://github.com/Phuong-Le/thesis_template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
```

### Usage

Once you have the repo downloaded, feel free to edit the setting as well as the content as much as you like. Please find a demo of what the thesis might look like in "thesis_template.pdf". "thesis_template.pdf" also contains detailed descriptions of the structure of this template.

For LaTeX beginners, if you're using this locally, you'll need to install [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/). I also find VSCode and its LaTeX Workshop extension very useful as a text editor for LaTex.
